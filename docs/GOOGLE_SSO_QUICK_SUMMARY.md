# Google SSO Implementation - Quick Answer

## How Hard Is It?

**Difficulty: Medium** (3-4 hours for basic implementation)

It's not _hard_, but it's tedious. Like assembling furniture - lots of pieces, specific order, and if you miss a step, nothing works.

## The Quick Path (Using Auth.js)

### 1. Install (5 minutes)

```bash
npm install @auth/sveltekit @auth/core
```

### 2. Google Setup (30-45 minutes)

- Create project in Google Cloud Console
- Enable Google+ API
- Create OAuth credentials
- Add redirect URLs

### 3. Code Changes (1-2 hours)

- Add auth configuration
- Update hooks
- Modify login page
- Protect admin routes

### 4. Testing (30 minutes)

- Test locally
- Deploy to preview
- Verify email restrictions work

## What Makes It "Not Hard but Annoying"

1. **Google Console** - Their UI changes often, documentation is sometimes outdated
2. **Redirect URLs** - Must match EXACTLY (http vs https, trailing slashes, etc.)
3. **Environment Variables** - Different for local/staging/production
4. **Session Management** - Need to handle properly for security

## Simpler Alternative

If you want something working TODAY:

1. Keep current password auth
2. Add a simple email whitelist
3. Store allowed emails in environment variable
4. Check email on login

```javascript
// Quick and dirty email check
const ALLOWED_EMAILS = process.env.ALLOWED_EMAILS?.split(",") || [];
if (ALLOWED_EMAILS.includes(loginEmail)) {
  // Allow access
}
```

## My Recommendation

For your use case (personal project, specific email access):

1. Start with the simple email whitelist
2. Add proper Google SSO later
3. This gets you secured today, fancy tomorrow

The current "admin123" password is like leaving your keys under the doormat. At least move them to under a different rock (email whitelist) until you can install a proper lock (Google SSO).
