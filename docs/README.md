# OBT Helper GPT Documentation

This directory contains all project documentation organized for both AI agents and human developers.

## Documentation Philosophy

Our documentation follows a **current-state-only approach**:

- **Current Implementation Only**: Document what exists and works now
- **Aggressive Archival**: Outdated information moved to consolidated archive immediately
- **Failure Prevention**: Archive failed approaches to prevent repetition
- **Context Efficiency**: Minimize outdated information in active documentation
- **Single Source of Truth**: One authoritative document per topic

## ü§ñ FOR AI AGENTS: READ FIRST

- **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)** - üö® MANDATORY reading for all AI agents before making any code changes

## Documentation Standards

### For AI Agents

- Start each document with scope and purpose
- Use consistent heading hierarchy (H1 ‚Üí H2 ‚Üí H3)
- Include code examples with file paths
- Keep sections under 500 words when possible
- Use bullet points for scannable information

### For Human Developers

- Include practical examples and use cases
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Cross-reference related documents
- Maintain up-to-date links and references
- Use clear, jargon-free language
