# Production Deployment Guide - v1.1.0

## ðŸš€ Deploying New Authentication to Netlify

Your code is pushing to GitHub and Netlify will auto-deploy. But you need to add the new environment variables first!

### 1. Add Environment Variables in Netlify

Go to: **Netlify Dashboard â†’ Your Site â†’ Site Settings â†’ Environment Variables**

**Add these NEW variables:**

```
VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD = [your-secure-password-from-local-env]
VITE_ALLOWED_ADMIN_EMAILS = christopher.klapp@eten.bible
```

**Existing variables (should already be there):**

```
OPENAI_API_KEY = [your-openai-key]
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = [your-twilio-sid]
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = [your-twilio-token]
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER = [your-whatsapp-number]
```

### 2. Check Deployment Status

1. Go to Netlify Dashboard â†’ Your Site â†’ Deploys
2. Look for the latest deploy (should show "Building" or "Published")
3. Click on it to see the build log

### 3. Test Production

Once deployed:

1. **Test Admin Access:**
   - Go to: `https://your-site.netlify.app/admin`
   - Email: `christopher.klapp@eten.bible`
   - Password: [your new password]
   - Should see "Welcome, christopher.klapp@eten.bible"

2. **Test Tool Editing:**
   - Edit a tool in admin
   - Check that changes persist
   - Test WhatsApp if configured

3. **Test Functions:**
   - Go to: `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/verify-sync`
   - Should see JSON with tool count and status

### 4. Troubleshooting

**If admin login fails:**

- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Look for typos in email address
- Verify password matches your local `.env`

**If tools don't save:**

- Check Netlify function logs
- Verify Netlify Blobs is enabled (should be automatic)

**If 404 on functions:**

- Check deploy completed successfully
- Functions should be in deploy log: "5 functions deployed"

### 5. Security Notes

âœ… **What's now secure:**

- No more "admin123" password
- Only your email can access admin
- Password stored in environment variables
- Proper session management

âœ… **Production checklist:**

- [ ] Environment variables added to Netlify
- [ ] Deploy completed successfully
- [ ] Admin login works with your email
- [ ] Tool editing persists changes
- [ ] WhatsApp integration (if using) works

### 6. Adding More Admins Later

To add more admins, update the environment variable:

```
VITE_ALLOWED_ADMIN_EMAILS = christopher.klapp@eten.bible,friend@example.com,admin@company.com
```

No code changes needed - just update the environment variable and redeploy.

### 7. Next Steps

- Monitor the deployment
- Test thoroughly
- Consider setting up Google SSO later (docs in GOOGLE_SSO_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
- Set up monitoring/alerts for your functions
