# WhatsApp Tool Sync - Quick Summary

## 🚨 Key Finding

The main issue is in `netlify/functions/tools.js` line ~137:

```javascript
// EMERGENCY FIX: Force production mode for demo
// TODO: Fix environment detection after demo
return false; // Always use Netlify Blobs
```

This forces the app to always use Netlify Blobs, even in local development, which can cause sync issues.

## 🛠️ Immediate Actions

### 1. Test Current State

```bash
# Start the app
netlify dev

# In another terminal, run the sync test
npm run test:whatsapp-sync

# Check sync status
curl http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/verify-sync
```

### 2. Fix Environment Detection

In `netlify/functions/tools.js`, update the `isLocalDevelopment()` function:

```javascript
function isLocalDevelopment() {
  return (
    process.env.NETLIFY_DEV === "true" ||
    process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ||
    !process.env.DEPLOY_URL
  );
}
```

### 3. Verify Fix

After making the change:

1. Restart `netlify dev`
2. Edit a tool in admin panel
3. Test with WhatsApp
4. Run `npm run test:whatsapp-sync` again

## 📊 How It Works (PRD-Aligned)

Admin → Save Tool → Edge Storage
↓
WhatsApp Function (with intent inference)
↓
Session Linking & Mirroring
↓
Use tool with context sync

## 🐛 Common Issues

1. **Storage Mismatch**: Admin saves to one place, WhatsApp reads from another
2. **Caching**: Old tool data cached in memory
3. **Environment**: Different behavior in dev vs production

## ✅ Success Indicators

- Intent switches work
- Sessions link across web/WA

## 🚀 Production Deployment

Before deploying:

1. Ensure environment variables are set in Netlify
2. Test with production-like environment locally
3. Monitor Netlify function logs after deployment
