# ⚠️ CRITICAL ARCHIVE NOTICE

## Conflicting UI/UX Documentation Has Been Archived

**Date**: January 16, 2025  
**Action**: Moved conflicting UI plans to prevent confusion during redesign

### What Was Archived

The following files have been moved to `docs/archive/conflicting-ui-plans/`:

1. **UI_MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md** - Suggested glassmorphism and complex animations (outdated)
2. **MULTIMODAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Feature implementation that's not current priority
3. **UI_COMPLETE_REDESIGN_PLAN.md** - First redesign attempt (superseded)
4. **phase1.md, phase2.md, phase3.md, epics.md** - Old roadmap with different priorities

### Current Source of Truth

**ONLY follow these documents for UI redesign:**

- `docs/MODERN_UI_PRD_2025.md` - The vision and specifications
- `docs/UI_REDESIGN_TASK_LIST.md` - The task list to implement

### Why This Matters

- The archived plans suggest glassmorphism (we want clean Apple 2025 spatial design)
- They prioritize features over fixing the broken UI
- They contain conflicting design directions
- Following them will result in a confused, inconsistent product

### For Agentic Coders

**DO NOT**:

- Look for UI guidance in /docs/issues/
- Implement glassmorphism effects
- Follow the old phase 1-3 roadmap
- Add multimodal features before UI is fixed

**DO**:

- Start with Phase 0 in UI_REDESIGN_TASK_LIST.md
- Follow Apple 2025 spatial design principles
- Focus on WhatsApp-first experience
- Keep it clean, simple, and polished

---

Remember: We're building for 2025, not 2020. Clean spatial design, not glass effects.
