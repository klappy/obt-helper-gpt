# Testing Guide

This document covers the comprehensive testing strategy for OBT Helper GPT, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing with Playwright.

## Current Test Status

✅ **Passing Tests (6/95)**

- Homepage loads with correct title and tools
- Admin link present in header
- Version information in footer
- Admin login page loads
- API tools endpoint functionality
- Chat navigation (with proper timing)

⚠️ **Known Issues**

- Voice controls not visible in headless mode (Web Speech API limitation)
- Admin authentication flow needs timing adjustments
- API tool updates require persistence verification fixes
- Mobile viewport navigation needs timing improvements

## Overview

Our testing approach includes:

- **Unit Tests**: Component-level testing with Vitest
- **Integration Tests**: Full application testing with Playwright
- **API Tests**: Backend function testing
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile
- **Performance Testing**: Load time and console error monitoring

## Test Structure

```
tests/
├── integration.test.ts    # Main integration test suite
└── unit/                  # Unit tests (future)
    └── components/
```

## Running Tests

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run integration tests (default)
npm run test:integration

# Run with visual UI
npm run test:integration:ui

# Run in headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:integration:headed

# Debug mode (step through tests)
npm run test:integration:debug
```

### Using the Test Runner Script

```bash
# Run integration tests
node scripts/test.js integration

# Run all tests
node scripts/test.js all

# Run with UI
node scripts/test.js integration:ui
```

## Test Categories

### 1. Homepage Tests

- ✅ Page loads with correct title
- ✅ All 6 AI tools are displayed
- ✅ Each tool has a "Start Chat" button
- ✅ Admin link is present
- ✅ Footer contains version information

### 2. Chat Interface Tests

- ✅ Navigation to chat pages works
- ✅ Message input and send functionality
- ✅ Input clears after sending
- ✅ Voice controls are visible

### 3. Admin Panel Tests

- ✅ Admin login page loads
- ✅ Authentication with password
- ✅ Tool management interface
- ✅ Tool editor functionality

### 4. API Integration Tests

- ✅ Tools API endpoint functionality
- ✅ Tool update operations
- ✅ Data persistence verification

### 5. Responsive Design Tests

- ✅ Mobile viewport (375x667)
- ✅ Tablet viewport (768x1024)
- ✅ Grid layout adaptation

### 6. Error Handling Tests

- ✅ 404 page handling
- ✅ Invalid tool ID handling

### 7. Performance Tests

- ✅ Page load time under 5 seconds
- ✅ No console errors on load

## Test Configuration

The test suite is configured via `playwright.config.ts`:

- **Base URL**: http://localhost:8888
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari
- **Auto-start**: Automatically starts `netlify dev` before tests
- **Screenshots**: Captured on failure
- **Videos**: Recorded on failure
- **Traces**: Available for debugging

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Netlify CLI**: For local development server
2. **Environment Variables**: VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY must be set
3. **Playwright Browsers**: Installed via `npx playwright install`

### Local Development Server

Tests expect the application to be running on `http://localhost:8888`. The Playwright config automatically starts `netlify dev` before running tests.

## Writing New Tests

### Test Structure Example

```typescript
test.describe("Feature Name", () => {
  test("should do something specific", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto("/");

    // Test actions
    await page.locator("button").click();

    // Assertions
    await expect(page.locator("h1")).toContainText("Expected Text");
  });
});
```

### Best Practices

1. **Descriptive Test Names**: Use "should" statements
2. **Page Object Pattern**: For complex interactions
3. **Wait for Elements**: Use `waitForLoadState` and `waitForSelector`
4. **Cleanup**: Reset state between tests when needed
5. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent

## Debugging Tests

### Visual Debugging

```bash
# Run with UI (recommended for development)
npm run test:integration:ui

# Run in headed mode to see browser
npm run test:integration:headed
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Step through tests with debugger
npm run test:integration:debug
```

### Screenshots and Videos

Failed tests automatically capture:

- Screenshots in `test-results/`
- Videos in `test-results/`
- Traces for detailed debugging

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Setup

```yaml
- name: Install Playwright
  run: npx playwright install --with-deps

- name: Run Integration Tests
  run: npm run test:integration
  env:
    VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

### Test Reports

Playwright generates HTML reports available at:

- Local: `playwright-report/index.html`
- CI: Uploaded as artifacts

## Test Data Management

### API Testing

Tests include API-level verification:

- Tool CRUD operations
- Data persistence
- Error handling

### State Management

- Tests use real API endpoints
- Temporary changes are reverted
- No test database required

## Performance Benchmarks

Current performance targets:

- **Page Load**: < 5 seconds
- **Console Errors**: 0
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 2 seconds (future)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Server Not Starting**
   - Check if port 8888 is available
   - Verify `netlify dev` works manually
   - Check environment variables

2. **Browser Installation**

   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

3. **Test Timeouts**
   - Increase timeout in `playwright.config.ts`
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify server performance

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check Playwright installation
npx playwright --version

# List available browsers
npx playwright install --dry-run

# Test specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Additions

1. **Unit Tests**: Component-level testing with Vitest
2. **Visual Regression**: Screenshot comparison testing
3. **Load Testing**: Performance under load
4. **Accessibility Testing**: Automated a11y checks
5. **API Contract Testing**: OpenAPI validation

### Test Coverage Goals

- **Integration Coverage**: 100% user journeys
- **Unit Coverage**: 80% component logic
- **API Coverage**: 100% endpoints
- **Browser Coverage**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile

## Contributing

When adding new features:

1. **Write Tests First**: TDD approach preferred
2. **Update Documentation**: Keep this guide current
3. **Run Full Suite**: Ensure no regressions
4. **Performance Check**: Verify load times
